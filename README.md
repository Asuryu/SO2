# Frogger
This application, implemented in C++20, has some defects that need to be addressed. These defects are as follows:

## Defects
1. **Non-functional game**: The current version of the game lacks essential information and relevant details.

2. **Client-Server Dependency**: The application currently requires the client to run on the same machine as the server, which is not the intended design.

3. **Communication Redesign**: The communication between operators and the server, as well as between the client and the server, should be reviewed and redesigned.

It's important to note that the use of C++20 was an optional choice and not a requirement from the class. However, it was chosen to provide an extra challenge for the practical work.
